Single Inheritance:

The inheritance in which a single derived class is inherited from a single base class is known as the Single Inheritance.


Single Inheritance Syntax

class A          // base class
{
    ..........
};
class B : acess_specifier A         // derived class
{
    ...........
} ;


Multiple Inheritance:

A class can be derived from more than one parent


Single Inheritance Syntax

class A          // base class1
{
    ..........
};
class B          // base class2
{
    ..........
};

class C : acess_specifier A,acess_specifier B         // derived class
{
    ...........
} ;



Mulilevel Inheritance:

The process of deriving a class from another derived class



Mulilevel Inheritance Syntax

class A          // base class
{
    ..........
};
class B : acess_specifier A         // derived class
{
    ...........
} ;

class C : acess_specifier B        // derived class
{
    ...........
} ;


Hierarchical inheritance:
The process of deriving multiple classes from a single base class.

Syntax:

Class A  
{  
   ............  
};  
Class B: access_specifier A  
{  
   .........  
};  
Class C: access_specifier A 
{  
  ............. 
};
