C for Loop
In programming, a loop is used to repeat a block of code until the specified condition is false.

C programming has three types of loops:

for loop
while loop
do...while loop

for Loop
The syntax of the for loop is:

for (initializationStatement; testExpression; updateStatement)
{
    // statements inside the body of loop
}



while Loop:
while Loop is an entry-controlled loop.
This loop can be used to iterate a part of code while 
the given condition remains true.

Syntax:
	
while(condition)
{
   statements;
increment/decrement;
}



do...while Loop:
	This is exit controlled loops.It allow repetitive execution of a 
block of code based on a condition that is checked after entering the loop.

syntax:

do {
     statements;
     increment/decrement;
}while(condition);
