Loop:
In programming, a loop is used to repeat a block of code until the specified condition is false.

Types of loops:
    1. for loop
    2. While loop
    3. do...while loop

1. for loop
When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop.
syntax:

for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement)
{
    statements;
}

2. while loop:

syntax:

while(condition)
{
    statements;
    increment/decrement;
}

3. do...while loop:
