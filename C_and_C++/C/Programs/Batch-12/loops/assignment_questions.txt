4. Display Multiplication Table for Multiple Numbers Using Nested Loops:
   - Write a C program to print the multiplication table of the first `n` numbers, where `n` is entered by the user.
   
   Input:
   Enter n: 3
   Output:
   Multiplication table for 1:
   1 x 1 = 1
   1 x 2 = 2
   1 x 3 = 3
   ...

   Multiplication table for 2:
   2 x 1 = 2
   2 x 2 = 4
   2 x 3 = 6
   ...
