Open the Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux).

Connect to your MySQL database. Use the following command and enter your MySQL root password when prompted:

bash
Copy code
mysql -u root -p
Replace root with your MySQL username if it's different.

Once connected, select the database you want to use. If your database is java_studentdb, use the following command:

sql
Copy code
USE java_studentdb;
View the tables. You can use the following command to see all the tables in the current database:

sql
Copy code
SHOW TABLES;
This will display a list of tables in the java_studentdb database.

View table structure. If you want to see the structure of a specific table, you can use the DESCRIBE command followed by the table name. For example, to see the structure of the student table:

sql
Copy code
DESCRIBE student;
This will display information about the columns (fields) in the student table.

Once you've finished viewing the tables, you can exit the MySQL command-line client by typing:

sql
Copy code
exit;
This will return you to the command prompt.
